## Introduction

The Hotel Management System is a desktop application designed to streamline and automate various hotel management tasks. This system provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for hotel staff to manage reservations, check-ins, check-outs, room availability, billing, and other hotel operations efficiently.

The project utilizes C# as the programming language and .NET as the framework for building the desktop application. The MSSQL database is used to store and manage data related to hotel rooms, reservations, guests, billing, and other relevant information.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karabunar/hotel-management.git
```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to restore NuGet packages and compile the application.
4. Configure the MSSQL database connection settings in the application.
